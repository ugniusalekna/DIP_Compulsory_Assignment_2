# Fourier Analysis for Image Processing Tasks
The second compulsory assignment for the course Digital Image Processing

This repository contains Compulsory Assignment 2. The assignment concerns the practical exercises covered
in weeks 6 to 8 of the course - Fourier transform, filtering in frequency space, and image restoration/ noise removal. The 
assignment is understood as a summary of this material, a practical implementation of it with some specific tasks to solve using it.
It also includes a report with a description of the theory behind each relevant topic, what practical challenges it may present
and how these and other choices affected the implementation.
